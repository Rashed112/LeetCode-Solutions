/*
* sub-array is continous set of an array. sub-sequence is series of numbers of the array, but must have to be in order of the main array. e.g. letâ€™s say an array, A={2, 6, 3, 9, 23} , now subarray could be {2, 6, 3}, {6, 3, 9} etc.. and sub-sequence could be {2, 3, 9}, {2, 6, 3} etc.
* have to think from the last position number where the sequence will end, and we'll change this last position of sequence and see which one have the largest sequence.
